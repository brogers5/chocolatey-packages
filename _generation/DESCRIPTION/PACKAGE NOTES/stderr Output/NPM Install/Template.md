While the package is being installed, you may see some messages logged to `stderr`, including warnings relating to deprecated package dependencies, or notice messages if `npm` itself is outdated. Note that these are not necessarily indicative of an error condition with the Chocolatey package. Therefore, you should ensure the `failOnStandardError` feature is disabled while installing/upgrading this package.
