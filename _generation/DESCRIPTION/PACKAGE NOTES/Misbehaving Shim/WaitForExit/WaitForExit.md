This package creates a [shim](https://docs.chocolatey.org/en-us/features/shim) to facilitate easier access to the command-line interface. However, `shimgen` will create a GUI shim, which will not wait for the underlying process to exit by default. This may cause issues with displaying console output when using the command-line interface or viewing debug messages. Users requiring this functionality should pass the `--shimgen-waitforexit` switch to ensure the shim behaves correctly.
