## Build

[Install Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/install), clone this repository, and run the following command in the cloned repository:
```shell
choco pack
```

A successful build will create `%packageId%.%versionTemplate%.nupkg`, where `%versionTemplate%` should be the Nuspec's `version` value at build time.

Note that Chocolatey package builds are non-deterministic. Consequently, an independently built package will fail a checksum validation against officially published packages.
