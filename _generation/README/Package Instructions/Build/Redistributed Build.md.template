## Build

[Install Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/install), %requiredModules%, then clone this repository.

Once cloned, simply run `build.ps1`. The %distributionType% %linkingVerb% intentionally untracked to avoid bloating the repository, so the script will download the %packageTitle% %packageType% %distributionType% from the %downloadLocation%, then packs everything together.

A successful build will create `%packageId%.%versionTemplate%.nupkg`, where `%versionTemplate%` should be the Nuspec's `version` value at build time.

Note that Chocolatey package builds are non-deterministic. Consequently, an independently built package will fail a checksum validation against officially published packages.
